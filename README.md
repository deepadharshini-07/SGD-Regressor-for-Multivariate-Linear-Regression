# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm

1.Import Libraries – Load necessary Python libraries.
2.Load Data – Read the dataset containing house details.
3.Preprocess Data – Clean and split the data into training and testing sets.
4.Select Features & Target – Choose input variables (features) and output variables (house price, occupants).
5.Train Model – Use SGDRegressor() to train the model.
6.Make Predictions – Use the model to predict house price and occupants.
7.Evaluate Performance – Check accuracy using error metrics.
8.Improve Model – Tune settings for better accuracy.
